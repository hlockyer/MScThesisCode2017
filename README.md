The code given within this repository is based upon a Python implementation of the Constraints on New Theories Using Rivet (CONTUR) methodology, written by Professor Jonathan Butterworth and David Yallup at University College London.

The files above are elements of the core statistics code, responsible for implementing limit setting on new physical models via the statistical method outlined by Butterworth et al in the following reference paper:

As such, elements of the code found within the files above have remained unchanged from their original versions. The intetion of this thesis was to build upon the existing code and software framework in an attempt to facilitate the inclusion of simulated Standard Model data that is not taken to be equal to background event counts.
